    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <div class="content3">
     
      <p>My self Akash, I have completed my bachelor’s degree in civil engineering at Delhi Engineering College, India which is one of the pioneer engineering colleges in India. I am a professional, hardworking and resilient civil engineer who takes great pride in not only the quality of work I produce but also the consistently high standards I aim to achieve for my employer.

        Now it’s the time to get an understanding of general interview questions that may pop up after the introductory discussion.I had always enjoyed construction work, even going back to my secondary school days. This led me to pursue graduation in Civil Engineering, for example in college, where I was an active member of every construction-related work. In addition to construction, I got to learn how to manage a team.

        After college, I took my first job at JLB Construction company as a site engineer, constructing a bridge over the highway, but I quickly realized my passion is on residential building projects, so I switched to the Building Engineering field. Here I discovered my planning and design skills and got the opportunity to enhance them.
        
        After switching to structural engineering as a designer role and managing the two projects successfully last year, I realized that I work best on the design software’s side and that’s my new area of strength.Well, “I’m currently as a Civil Project Engineer at HCC Construction, where I lead two multi-story design projects.
